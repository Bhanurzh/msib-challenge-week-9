# Challenge Week 9 - To Do App

In this challenge, we will build a simple To-Do App. This app has two main features: creating an activity and adding items to the activity. Currently, we have an incomplete project, and your task is to complete the project based on the challenge objectives.

Here's the structure of the project:

```bash
│   index.js        # App entry point
│   server.js        # Our express server configuration
└───config          # Environment variables and configuration related stuff
└───controllers     # Handle requests and serves error responses
└───middlewares     # Contains all the middleware that we need
└───models          # Database models
└───repositories    # Data access layer for querying and manipulation of database
└───routes          # Our routes controllers for all the endpoints of the app
└───services        # Business logic of our app
└───utils           # Common functions that would be used repetitively
```
